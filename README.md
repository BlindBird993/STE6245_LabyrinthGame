# STE6245_LabyrinthGame
Simple maze simulation with gameplay elements, collisions and physics implementation.

Game was created using Qt framework and GMlib - special purpose OpenGL rendering engine for geometric modelling, developed at the Narvik University.

Structure of the maze is created as a box which consists of simple planes, sphere with collision detection represents active element which can be moved through the maze by user.

Collision detection between sphere and plane, as well as between different spheres was implemented.
